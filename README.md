# CDK For Dummies

This repository is currently in development.  The goal is to put together everything I have learned so far into a neat package for others to learn from!

## Introduction

Imagine you are a Cloud Architect and your business needs an API for a microservice.  This is a common solution to many problems.

There are many steps to setting an API up "Production-ready".  That's where this repository comes in.

There is also a CI Pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building and deployment.
